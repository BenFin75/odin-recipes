        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is the recipe for my favorite Korean beef bowl, or Bulgogi dish. 
            I adapted this recipe ffrom a gif recipe on reddit. I think I have 
            made it more authentic with the addition of Gochujang paste, and both
            light and dark soy suace. This dish is pretty quick to make, but always 
            remember to start the rice BEFORE you start cooking the dish, or you 
            will need to wait on the rice and the beef may get cold.
